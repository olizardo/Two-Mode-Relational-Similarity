\begin{abstract}
In a previous paper, Kovacs \citeyearpar{kovacs2010} proposed a generalized relational similarity measure based on iterated correlations of entities in a network calibrated by their relational similarity to other entities. Here I show that, in the case of two-mode network data, Kovacs's approach can be simplified and generalized similarities calculated non-iteratively. The basic idea is to rely on initial similarities calculated from transforming the two-mode data into one-mode projections using the familiar duality approach due to Breiger \citeyearpar{breiger1974}. I refer to this as the two-mode correlation distance and show, using the Southern Women data, that it yields results substantively identical to Kovacs's.

\section{Introduction}
In a previous paper, Kovacs \citeyearpar{kovacs2010} introduced a generalized relational similarity measure based on iterated correlations applicable to two-mode and one-mode network data. According to Kovacs, a desirable generalized similarity measure must have two desirable properties. First, (1) it should respect the \textit{principle of equivalence}, such that it classifies actors as similar if they have similar relations to other objects who are themselves similar Second, (2) the similarity measure should respect the \textit{principle of duality} \citep{breiger1974}, such that it classifies actors as similar if they have similar relations to similar objects, and objects as similar if they have similar relations to similar actors within the same system. 

Kovacs's key observation is that such a generalized relational similarity measure could be obtained by transforming the usual correlation distance measure. Particularly, Kovacs begins by noting that in the two-mode case, the correlation distance between any pair of actors $D(A)^{cor}_{i,j}$ be expressed as a function of their row profiles in actors $\times$ objects affiliation matrix $\mathbf{M}$ as follows:

\begin{equation}
    D(A)^{cor}_{i,j} = 
    \frac{
    (M_{i\bullet} - \bar{M_{i\bullet}})
    (M_{j\bullet} - \bar{M_{j\bullet}})^T
    }
    {
    \sqrt{
    (M_{i\bullet} - \bar{M_{i\bullet}})
    (M_{i\bullet} - \bar{M_{i\bullet}})^T
    (M_{j\bullet} - \bar{M_{j\bullet}})
    (M_{j\bullet} - \bar{M_{j\bullet}})^T
        }
    }
    \label{eq:1}
\end{equation}

Where $M_{i\bullet}$ is the row profile corresponding to actor $i$, $M_{j\bullet}$ is the row profile corresponding to actor $j$, $\bar{M_{i\bullet}}$ is the row mean for actor $i$, and $\bar{M_{j\bullet}}$ is the row mean for actor $j$ in the affiliation matrix. The same approach can be used to find the correlation distance between any two column objects $D(O)^{cor}_{i, j}$, by substituting their column profiles $(M_{\bullet i}, M_{\bullet j})$ and column means $(\bar{M_{\bullet i}}, \bar{M_{\bullet j})}$ into equation \ref{eq:1}. Overall, increasingly positive values of the correlation distance indicate actor similarity, while negative values  indicate actor dissimilarity, with values bounded in the $(-1, 1)$ interval.

Kovacs noted that the correlation distance classifies actors as similar if they have similar relations to other objects, but fails to incorporate the inter-object similarities. That is, actors should receive more similarity ``points'' if they connect to objects that are themselves similar. To this end, consider a matrix $\mathbf{S(O)}$ with cell entries $s(o)_{ij}$ capturing pairwise similarities between the objects in the two-mode network. In this case, a generalized relational similarity (GRS) measure for actors based on the correlation distance can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
    D(A)^{grs}_{i,j} = 
    \frac{
    (M_{i\bullet} - \bar{M_{i\bullet}})
    \mathbf{S(O)}
    (M_{j\bullet} - \bar{M_{j\bullet}})^T
    }
    {
    \sqrt{
    (M_{i\bullet} - \bar{M_{i\bullet}})
    \mathbf{S(O)}
    (M_{i\bullet} - \bar{M_{i\bullet}})^T
    }
    \sqrt{
    (M_{j\bullet} - \bar{M_{j\bullet}})
    \mathbf{S(O)}
    (M_{j\bullet} - \bar{M_{j\bullet}})^T
        }
    }
    \label{eq:2}
\end{equation}

Kovacs notes that if we have access to an analogous matrix of similarities between actors $\mathbf{S(A)}$ in the network, then we would be able to also calculate a generalized relational similarity score for objects $D(O)_{grs}$ by plugging in that matrix and the column profiles and means into equation \ref{eq:2}, yielding:

\begin{equation}
    D(O)^{grs}_{i,j} = 
    \frac{
    (M_{\bullet i} - \bar{M_{\bullet i}})
    \mathbf{S(A)}
    (M_{\bullet i} - \bar{M_{\bullet i}})^T
    }
    {
    \sqrt{
    (M_{\bullet i} - \bar{M_{\bullet i}})
    \mathbf{S(A)}
    (M_{\bullet i} - \bar{M_{\bullet i}})^T
    }
    \sqrt{
    (M_{\bullet j} - \bar{M_{\bullet j}})
    \mathbf{S(A)}
    (M_{\bullet j} - \bar{M_{\bullet j}})^T
        }
    }
    \label{eq:3}
\end{equation}

Typically, people only have access to the network information and not exogenous indication of pre-existing similarities between actors or objects, required to compute \ref{eq:2}, and \ref{eq:3}. Kovacs's (ingenious) solution is to use the duality property and compute ``reflective similarities'' by first computing initial object similarities by plugging $D(A)_{cor}$ into \ref{eq:3} (equivalent to substituting the identity matrix, of dimensions $O \times O$, into the slot occupied by $\mathbf{S(O)}$ in \ref{eq:2}). Then using the resulting actor similarities to compute generalized object similarities. This is done by substituting a $A \times A$ matrix of $D(A)_{grs}$ values obtained in the first step into the slot occupied by $\mathbf{S(A)}$ in \ref{eq:3}. The iterations continue until both $D(A)_{grs}$ and $D(A)_{grs}$ ``freeze'' according to some stopping criterion ($\epsilon$). 

\section{Two Mode Generalized Similarities}
The basic purpose of this comment is to show that there is a simpler alternative to the iteration approach to computing generalized relational similarities in two-mode data. This alternative respects the basic spirit of Kovacs's proposal, namely, the principles of equivalence and duality, while exploiting the duality of actors and objects in two-mode networks more directly.

The basic idea is that similarity matrices that can play the role of $\mathbf{S(A)}$ and $\mathbf{S(O)}$ can be obtained from any two-mode network without iteration. Instead, they can be computed via Breiger's \citeyearpar{breiger1974} well-known dual projection approach (see also \citep{everett2013}). 

This procedure has two major steps. First, we obtain actor co-membership ($\mathbf{AA}$) and object overlap matrices ($\mathbf{OO}$) from the affiliation matrix ($\mathbf{M}$) following the well-known formulas:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{AA} = \mathbf{MM^T}
    \label{eq:4}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{OO} = \mathbf{M^TM}
    \label{eq:5}
\end{equation}

For both $\mathbf{AA}$ and $\mathbf{OO}$, the $ij^{th}$ entry is the number of objects shared by persons $i$ and $j$ and the number of actors who choose both objects $i$ and $j$ respectively. The diagonal entries in $AA_{ij}$ record the number of objects each actor chooses, and the diagonal entries in $OO_{ij}$ record the number of actors choosing each object. 

Once we have these one-mode projections, it is straightforward to compute similarity measures across actors based on their co-memberships and across objects in terms of the actors they share. The basic idea is that the similarity between actors increases as the number of common objects chosen increases, and the similarity between objects increases as the number of actors who choose both objects, suitably weighted by both actors ``expansiveness" and object ``popularity" (the diagonal entries of $\mathbf{AA}$ and $\mathbf{OO}$, respectively). 

Many options are available here (and the results are invariant to this choice), but the cosine similarity is a straightforward candidate. For actors, this is given by:

\begin{equation}
    S(A)^{cos}_{ij} = \frac{AA_{ij}}{\sqrt{AA_{ii}AA_{jj}}}
    \label{eq:6}
\end{equation}

And for objects:

\begin{equation}
    S(O)^{cos}_{ij} = \frac{OO_{ij}}{\sqrt{OO_{ii}OO_{jj}}}
    \label{eq:7}
\end{equation}

We can then compute a distance matrix containing relational similarities between actors and objects directly without iteration, which I refer to as \textit{two-mode relationality similarity}. 

For actors, this is:

\begin{equation}
    D(A)^{tmrs}_{i,j} = 
    \frac{
    (M_{i\bullet} - \bar{M_{i\bullet}})
    \mathbf{S(O)^{cos}}
    (M_{j\bullet} - \bar{M_{j\bullet}})^T
    }
    {
    \sqrt{
    (M_{i\bullet} - \bar{M_{i\bullet}})
    \mathbf{S(O)^{cos}}
    (M_{i\bullet} - \bar{M_{i\bullet}})^T
    }
    \sqrt{
    (M_{j\bullet} - \bar{M_{j\bullet}})
    \mathbf{S(O)^{cos}}
    (M_{j\bullet} - \bar{M_{j\bullet}})^T
        }
    }
    \label{eq:8}
\end{equation}

And correspondingly, for objects, this is given by:

\begin{equation}
    D(O)^{tmrs}_{i,j} = 
    \frac{
    (M_{\bullet i} - \bar{M_{\bullet i}})
    \mathbf{S(A)^{cos}}
    (M_{\bullet i} - \bar{M_{\bullet i}})^T
    }
    {
    \sqrt{
    (M_{\bullet i} - \bar{M_{\bullet i}})
    \mathbf{S(A)^{cos}}
    (M_{\bullet i} - \bar{M_{\bullet i}})^T
    }
    \sqrt{
    (M_{\bullet j} - \bar{M_{\bullet j}})
    \mathbf{S(A)^{cos}}
    (M_{\bullet j} - \bar{M_{\bullet j}})^T
        }
    }
    \label{eq:9}
\end{equation}

Where everything is as before. It is easy to see that equations \ref{eq:8} and \ref{eq:9} respect the principle of equivalence. Actors count as similar to the extent they connect to similar objects ($\mathbf{S(O)^{cos}}$). Conversely, objects count as similar to the extent they are chosen by similar actors ($ \mathbf{S(A)^{cos}}$). Because the similarities are defined according to the dual projection method, in which the similarity of actors is based on the objects they choose, and the similarity of objects is based on the actors who choose them, the measure also respects the principle of duality.

\section{Analysis of Southern Women Data}
In this section, I re-analyze Davis et al.'s \citeyearpar{davis1941}, Southern Women Data---also analyzed by Kovacs---showing that both Kovacs's iterated approach ($D^{grs}$) and the more direct two-mode approach ($D^{tmrs}$) yield comparable results. Like Kovacs, I take Doreian et al.'s generalized blockmodeling partitioning of actors and events as a reference point \citeyearpar[Table 4]{doreian2004}. An optimal ``unsupervised'' similarity-based partition should thus yield three clusters of actors $C_1^A =$ \{Evelyn, Laura, Theresa, Brenda, Charlotte, Frances, Eleanor, Ruth\}, $C_2^A=$ \{Verne Myra, Katherine, Sylvia, Nora, Helen, Olivia, Flora\}, and $C_3^A=$ \{Pearl, Dorothy\} and three clusters of events $C_1^E=$ \{$E_1$, $E_2$, $E_3$, $E_4$, $E_5$\}, $C_2^E=$ \{$E_6$, $E_7$, $E_8$, $E_9$\}, $C_3^E=$ \{$E_{10}$, $E_{11}$, $E_{12}$, $E_{13}$, $E_{14}$\}. Figures \ref{fig:actors} and \ref{fig:events} summarize the main thrust of the findings.\footnote{All plots are built using the \texttt{ggplot2} grammar of graphics \citep{wickham16}.}
 
 Figure \ref{fig:grm-actors} replicates Kovacs's \citeyearpar{kovacs2010} Figure 12b exactly using the author's implementation of Kovacs's algorithm written as a function for the \textit{R} statistical computing environment (see Supplementary materials). After fourteen iterations, the algorithm converged (using $\epsilon = 0.001$). As Kovacs noted, the distribution of points in the two-dimensional MDS space obtained using the generalized relational similarities corresponds to the generalized blockmodeling solution reported by Doreian et al., with two large sets of similar actors separated from one another and the more peripheral Dorothy and Pearl. Although the k-means clustering misclassifies Pearl as belonging to the first large cluster and puts Dorothy in her own singleton cluster. 
 
 As Figure~\ref{fig:tmrs-actors} shows, the two-mode relational similarity approach yields comparable results to Kovacs's generalized relational similarities, thus also revealing Doreian et al.'s actor blocks. Notably, the k-means three-cluster solution for the two-mode relational similarities correctly assigns Pearl and Dorothy to their own cluster (coming closer to Doreian et al.'s generalized blockmodeling results). Still, it misclassifies Pearl as also belonging to the peripheral third cluster. 

  \begin{figure}[ht!]
     \begin{subfigure}[b]{1.0\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Plots/grm-events.png}
        \caption{}
        \label{fig:grm-events}
    \end{subfigure} 
     \begin{subfigure}[b]{1.0\textwidth}

    \end{subfigure} 
    \caption{Two-dimensional metric multidimensional scaling plots of generalized relational similarities for events in the Southern Women data. Colors correspond to a five-group k-means clustering of the relational similarities, with cluster centroids determined by a first-step hierarchical clustering according to Ward's \citeyearpar{ward63} criterion.}
    \label{fig:events}
 \end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:events} reports the corresponding analysis for relational similarities of the object (events). In the original paper, Kovacs \citeyearpar[206]{kovacs2010}, described these results verbally---no plot was provided---as follows:

\begin{quote}
The generalized similarity model provides a grouping for the events as well (not shown here). This grouping differs slightly from Doreian et al.'s \citeyearpar{doreian2004} grouping: although the (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and (10, 11, 12, 13, 14) clusters emerge in the generalized similarity solution as well, the picture differs for events 6, 7, 8, and 9. Event 6 here is clustered together with (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), while events 7, 8 and 9 do not fall into any group but stand separately  (206). 
\end{quote}

Figure~\ref{fig:grm-events} replicates Kocacs's verbal description of the results using generalized relational similarities. A five-group k-means clustering of the distances in the multidimensional scaling space separates events 1-6 and 10-14 while assigning events 7, 8, and 9 to their own singleton cluster. As Figure~\ref{fig:tmrs-events} shows, the two-mode relational similarity approach yields substantively identical results to Kovacs's relational similarities regarding events. 

\section{Conclusion}
Kovacs \citeyearpar{kovacs2010} made a case that a desirable metric for relational similarity should respect at least two basic desiderata, which I have referred to as the principles of equivalence and duality, proposing an approach based on iterated correlations that met these criteria. In this short note, I have shown that we can get there using a more straightforward, non-iterative approach, more directly grounded in the principle of duality via the dual projection approach to analyzing two-mode data \citep{everett2013}. 

Like Kovacs, this approach tunes the correlation distances between entities in one mode based on their connection to similar entities in the other mode, as revealed by the one-mode projections. A replication of Kovacs's analysis of Davis et al.'s \citeyearpar{davis1941} Southern Women Data and a re-analysis based on the proposed alternative metric shows that the two-mode relational similarity approach yields substantively identical results to those obtained using the generalized similarity strategy.

\section[Theorem and ...]{Theorem and theorem like environments}

{cas-dc.cls} provides a few shortcuts to format theorems and
theorem-like environments with ease. In all commands the options that
are used with the \verb+\newtheorem+ command will work exactly in the same
manner. {cas-dc.cls} provides three commands to format theorem or
theorem-like environments: 

\begin{verbatim}
 \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
 \newtheorem{lemma}[theorem]{Lemma}
 \newdefinition{rmk}{Remark}
 \newproof{pf}{Proof}
 \newproof{pot}{Proof of Theorem \ref{thm2}}
\end{verbatim}


The \verb+\newtheorem+ command formats a
theorem in \LaTeX's default style with italicized font, bold font
for theorem heading and theorem number at the right hand side of the
theorem heading.  It also optionally accepts an argument which
will be printed as an extra heading in parentheses. 

\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{theorem}

\end{theorem}

The \verb+\newdefinition+ command is the same in
all respects as its \verb+\newtheorem+ counterpart except that
the font shape is roman instead of italic.  Both
\verb+\newdefinition+ and \verb+\newtheorem+ commands
automatically define counters for the environments defined.

The \verb+\newproof+ command defines proof environments with
upright font shape.  No counters are defined. 


\section[Enumerated ...]{Enumerated and Itemized Lists}
{cas-dc.cls} provides an extended list processing macros
which makes the usage a bit more user friendly than the default
\LaTeX{} list macros.   With an optional argument to the
\verb+\begin{enumerate}+ command, you can change the list counter
type and its attributes.

\begin{verbatim}
 \begin{enumerate}[1.]
 \item The enumerate environment starts with an optional
   argument `1.', so that the item counter will be suffixed
   by a period.
 \item You can use `a)' for alphabetical counter and '(i)' 
  for roman counter.
  \begin{enumerate}[a)]
    \item Another level of list with alphabetical counter.
    \item One more item before we start another.
    \item One more item before we start another.
    \item One more item before we start another.
    \item One more item before we start another.
\end{verbatim}

Further, the enhanced list environment allows one to prefix a
string like `step' to all the item numbers.  

\begin{verbatim}
 \begin{enumerate}[Step 1.]
  \item This is the first step of the example list.
  \item Obviously this is the second step.
  \item The final step to wind up this example.
 \end{enumerate}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Cross-references}
In electronic publications, articles may be internally
hyperlinked. Hyperlinks are generated from proper
cross-references in the article.  For example, the words
\textcolor{black!80}{Fig.~1} will never be more than simple text,
whereas the proper cross-reference \verb+\ref{tiger}+ may be
turned into a hyperlink to the figure itself:
\textcolor{blue}{Fig.~1}.  In the same way,
the words \textcolor{blue}{Ref.~[1]} will fail to turn into a
hyperlink; the proper cross-reference is \verb+\cite{Knuth96}+.
Cross-referencing is possible in \LaTeX{} for sections,
subsections, formulae, figures, tables, and literature
references.

\section{Bibliography}

Two bibliographic style files (\verb+*.bst+) are provided ---
{model1-num-names.bst} and {model2-names.bst} --- the first one can be
used for the numbered scheme. This can also be used for the numbered
with new options of {natbib.sty}. The second one is for the author year
scheme. When  you use model2-names.bst, the citation commands will be
like \verb+\citep+,  \verb+\citet+, \verb+\citealt+ etc. However when
you use model1-num-names.bst, you may use only \verb+\cite+ command.

\verb+thebibliography+ environment.  Each reference is a\linebreak
\verb+\bibitem+ and each \verb+\bibitem+ is identified by a label,
by which it can be cited in the text:

\noindent In connection with cross-referencing and
possible future hyperlinking it is not a good idea to collect
more that one literature item in one \verb+\bibitem+.  The
so-called Harvard or author-year style of referencing is enabled
by the \LaTeX{} package {natbib}. With this package the
literature can be cited as follows:

\begin{enumerate}[\textbullet]
\item Parenthetical: \verb+\citep{WB96}+ produces (Wettig \& Brown, 1996).
\item Textual: \verb+\citet{ESG96}+ produces Elson et al. (1996).
\item An affix and part of a reference:\break
\verb+\citep[e.g.][Ch. 2]{Gea97}+ produces (e.g. Governato et
al., 1997, Ch. 2).
\end{enumerate}

In the numbered scheme of citation, \verb+\cite{<label>}+ is used,
since \verb+\citep+ or \verb+\citet+ has no relevance in the numbered
scheme.  {natbib} package is loaded by {cas-dc} with
\verb+numbers+ as default option.  You can change this to author-year
or harvard scheme by adding option \verb+authoryear+ in the class
loading command.  If you want to use more options of the {natbib}
package, you can do so with the \verb+\biboptions+ command.  For
details of various options of the {natbib} package, please take a
look at the {natbib} documentation, which is part of any standard
\LaTeX{} installation.

\appendix
\section{My Appendix}
Appendix sections are coded under \verb+\appendix+.

\verb+\printcredits+ command is used after appendix sections to list 
author credit taxonomy contribution roles tagged using \verb+\credit+ 
in frontmatter.
